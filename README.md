Avocado
=========
 
A boilerplate for smaller websites or web applications using PHP.
 
Built by Anton Lundberg, based on Anax by Mikael Roos

Description
-----------

Avodado is an easy-to-use web boilerplate. With the simple but
effective tools provided in this standard package you will,
with only some prior PHP knowledge, be able to assemble a
decent web page.

Instructions
------------

Download all files in this repository and place them on your
server. Try pointing your browser to the 'home.php' file (in
the 'webroot' folder). The template should appear as expected.

All you have to do now is to open each PHP-file in your
editor and alter the content to suit your business. Also
change the settings in 'config.php' to suit your needs.

Avocado comes with a couple of modules and classes that you
might find useful. Each individual module is well documented,
so if you want to use them, read through the source codes.
Provided modules are as listed:

* CDatabase - a class for communicating with databases using PHP PDO
* CCalendar - a module for displaying a calendar
* CCart - a simple shopping cart using session cookies
* CImage - a tool for processing image files on the server side (through the page controller img.php)
* CTextFilter - a class for converting strings using different formatting syntax (such as bbcode or markdown) to HTML
